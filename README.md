This is my personal portfolio site. The tooling and structure is based on Google's [Web Starter Kit].

If you'd like to run the site locally clone the repo and run `npm install`. You can then use `gulp serve` to start a Browser-Sync server that will watch for your changes and auto-update your browser.
